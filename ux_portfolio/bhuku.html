      <p class="goal-desc">Bhuku has started collecting data on popular books. Inspired by goodreads.com, Bhuku wants to give a more user-centric approach to their app, and add features and flows that make it delightful for people to use. Along with some
        of the main features, like Scanning books and engaging the user with notifications, they want to integrate local communities into the app to give the users opportunities to be involved in the community based on their interests and needs.</p>

      <h2 class="goal-title">Research</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The research was done based on the end goal of understanding how to give users a more seamless approach to Bhuku by adding features and flows that make it delightful for people to use. The research questions were based on
        understanding what the user experience was like with current applications and what inspired the user to use the application. In addition to these, We also conducted primary and secondary research on engagement with an application and the motivation
        behind users spending more time on direct and indirect competitors’ applications. In addition to the research, a card sorting and site map validation was conducted with 6 and 7 users respectively. The results from the interviews, research and surveys
        were used to inform us on understanding why users make use of applications like Goodreads and other competitors. We understood the motivations for using different platforms and in the process, what pain points and delights the user experience’s.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Research Process</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The primary and secondary research led to creating a user persona, Sara Barrowman, a 30 year old Art graduate student, going to school at Savannah College of Art and Design . Sara enjoys reading books for pleasure and educational
        purposes, and it is very important to her to be able to access and catalogue books as she reads them. She borrows a lot of the books from her local library and loves to attend local book events.</p>

      <p class="quote">I usually find books on reddit, look it up on amazon to see if they are worth buying</p>
    </section>
    <p class="goal-desc">The creation of Sara Barrowman, led to a customer journey that helped understand what pain points users experience with the current applications, specifically the widely popular goodreads, as well as the user’s motivation to
      share thoughts and discuss books through various mediums.

    <img src="Assets/Bhuku/1x/customer_journey_map@1x.png" alt="customer journey map" class="case-study-images">
    <p class="goal-desc">The results from the customer journey map, research and surveys were used to inform us on what the users primarily look for in a cataloguing application and how we can effectively incorporate these elements into a local community
      driven application. One of the most stated pain points was that the user did not find the any of the current applications very intuitive and that there were too many steps involved and not enough visibility on available features. To research some of
      the information architecture, a competitor analysis was conducted.</p>

      <p class="goal-desc">Understanding what users experienced when using current book cataloguing applications, and what increased the drop out rate led to ten Point Of View statements, which were narrowed down three statements which helped us start
        ideating using the crazy eight methodology, along with brainstorming during the session. Card sorting exercises were conducted with 15 participants as well, leading to a site map and user flow</p>

      <p class="goal-desc">The wireframes were combined with the UI Kit to create high fidelity prototypes in invision, using craft, which were then usability tested by 4 participants. The tasks they were expected to complete were:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul class="goal-desc">
        <li>Sign up as a new user on Bhuku and preview a book based on recommendations</li>
        <li>Find book clubs and borrow the book of the month from the local library</li>
        <li>Find out what the local book events and their details are</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">Combining the research and implementation, the final prototypes were created. If you would like to take a look at the protoype and experience it yourself, please click

      <h2 class="goal-title">Usability Testing</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">4 Participants that fit the requirements for this project were recruited for this usability test and completed the required tasks at their homes on a android phone using the invision app prototype. The participant’s interaction
        with the application was monitored by the facilitator seated in the same, as well as remote location.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The participants' responsibilities were to attempt to complete a set of representative task scenarios presented to them in as efficient and timely a manner as possible, and provide feedback regarding the usability and
        acceptability of the user interface.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The testing process led to a few revisions that informed and validated the design and features implemented on the prototypes.</p>

      <p class="quote">I really like the colors. I’m excited to use the app!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section-design-process">
      <h2 class="goal-title">Summary</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">Most of the expectations and hypothesis were validated by the usability testing, and integrating local communities on the Bhuku application was successful. The participants made a few suggestions, including changing the style of
        the blind date with the books section, which was implemented. Designing and implementing an end to end application was very rewarding beause of the freedom it allowed. The information architecture proved to be quite challenging, and pushed us to ask
        unconventional questions about how users would be interested in being intergrated to the local community. The next steps include designing the remaining screens based on the rest of the user flows on the app, as well as conducting more extensive
        usability testing to accomodate a wider audience.</p>
