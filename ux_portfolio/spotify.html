      <h2 class="goal-title">Overview</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">Spotify’s mission is to help people listen to whatever music they want, whenever they want, wherever they want. They want to improve engagement by adding an effective sharing functionality that allows the user to expand their
        social functionality by sharing music within the Spotify application, as well as using integrated third party applications.</p>

      <h2 class="goal-title">Research</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The goal of the research was to understand how we can increase the number of users sharing music through the Spotify application and what the current experience of sharing music was like for users and how it can be improved.
        Secondary research was conducted based on direct and indirect competitiors like Pandora, Apple Music, Match.com and Dropbox. The sharing feature as well as the workarounds were researched along with participant interviews. The results from the
        interviews, research and surveys were used to inform us on understanding why users may not be sharing music and what can be done to encourage it. In the scenario, that users do share music, understanding what motivated them and implementing the
        features to increase the sharing of music on the spotify application and create an intuitive sharing experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section-design-process">
      <h2 class="subtitle">Research Process</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The primary and secondary research led to creating a user persona, Adam Beckman, a 28 year old Web Developer living in Chicago, IL. Adam really enjoys his field and spends a lot of his spare time on personal projects. He uses
        spotify extensively to get into the zone when coding, which makes music an integral part of his lifestyle.</p>

      <p class="quote">I had no idea that Spotify even had a share music functionality. Where do I find it? Oh. Maybe it’s in the three dot menu thing</p>
    </section>
    <p class="goal-desc">The creation of Adam Beckman, led to a customer journey to understand what type of workarounds users come up with to share music. This customer journey map helped us understand the user’s motivation to share through specific
      mediums, and validated our intial assumption, that users were more likely to share music when the share functionality was clear and visible.</p>
    <img src="Assets/spotify/customer_journey_map.png" alt="customer journey map" class="case-study-images">
    <p class="goal-desc">The results from the customer journey map, research and surveys were used to inform us on how we can effectively incorporate elements into the sharing process, what encourages users to share more music and how we can increase the
      share functionality’s visibility.
      <br>The biggest pain points discovered during the research stage was that the participants were worried about being judged for their music habits, as well as, most users were not aware of a share functionality existing.</p>

      <h2 class="goal-title">Information Architecture</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">Understanding how Adam thinks and prioritizes the sharing of music, led to a few ideas by incorporating the Crazy Eight Ideation methodology to come up with rapid ideas, which led to crazy eight storyboards. We were able to do
        low fidelity user testing to validate the user flow with the help of the storyboards. After the storyboards were mapped out, 2 user flows were created to depict how a user would potentially share music within the spotify application, as well as
        incorporating third party applications when the the user would like to send an individual song to a friend that does not use Spotify.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The participants' responsibilities were to attempt to complete a set of representative task scenarios presented to them in as efficient and timely a manner as possible, and provide feedback regarding the usability and
        acceptability of the user interface.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The testing process led to a few revisions that informed and validated the design and features implemented on the prototypes.

    <section class="main-section-design-process">
      <h2 class="goal-title">Summary</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">Most of the expectations and hypothesis were validated by the usability testing, and the implementation share functionality on the Spotify application was successful. A few suggestions were made by the participants, which
        included adding the share functionality at the top of the screen, so it would be less intrusive, as well as allowing the user to choose what music listening habits they want to advertise. Adding a feature to an already existing successful application
        proved to be challenging and thought provoking. There are a number of different sharing functionalities can be added to the feature, such as letting users make groups of friends that they share music with the most, or even gamifying the sharing
        experience by adding points everytime a song is shared. There is a lot of potential for adding more functionality to the sharing feature, and is something we are excited to explore further.</p>
