      <p class="goal-desc">Zeit wants their users to have easy access to tickets and schedules along with providing information to their customers in a clear and concise manner. A total of 289 destinations will be available to choose from , ranging from

      <h2 class="goal-title">Research</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The goal of the research was to understand the user’s pain points and analyze the key insights by correlating research data and user goals. With time travel tourism being the first of its kind, indirect secondary research of
        travel booking, hotel reservation and adventure booking sites was conducted. Participants were interviewed, which led to user personas, empathy maps and feature matrices.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Research Process</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">The primary and secondary research led to creating a user persona, Madeleine, a successful 28 year old graphic designer from New York City, and an avid traveller and adventure lover.</p>

        providing this is really helpful.</p>
    </section>

    <p class="goal-desc">The results from the interviews, research and surveys were used to inform us on what elements we can incorporate into the ticket booking process, what encourages users to book certain trips and how we can make the product stand
      out while keeping the core functionality that makes travel booking a great user experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="goal-desc">The biggest pain point discovered during the research stage was that the participants were frustrated with the inconsistencies between different booking sites as well as the lack of easy customer service options</p>

      <p class="goal-desc">The wireframes were combined with a style tile and brand logo to create high fidelity prototypes in invision which were usability tested by 5 participants. The tasks they were expected to complete were:

      <ul class="goal-desc">
        <li>Explore and book a time travel trip</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">Zeit time travel offers trips of a lifetime and prioritizes safety and clarity of information for their customers. To emphasize this, the layout consisted of clean lines, and ample white space. The colors were chosen to create a

      <p class="goal-desc">5 Participants that fit the requirements for this project were recruited for this usability test and completed the required tasks at their homes on a MacBook using google chrome to navigate the prototype on the Invision app . The
        participant’s interaction with the Web site/Web application was monitored by the facilitator seated in the same location. One participant did remote testing and was monitored by the facilitator through the Skype screen sharing feature.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The participants' responsibilities were to attempt to complete a set of representative task scenarios presented to them in as efficient and timely a manner as possible, and provide feedback regarding the usability and
        acceptability of the user interface.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="goal-desc">The testing process led to an affinity map that informed and validated the design and features implemented on the prototypes.

    <section class="main-section-design-process">
      <h2 class="goal-title">Summary</h2>
      <p class="goal-desc">Most of the expectations and hypothesis were validated by the usability testing, and with a few exceptions, which were mostly related to the lack of feature interaction due to the low fidelity protoype, the Zeit ecommerce
        usability testing was successful. A few suggestions were repeatedly made by the participants, which included increasing the font size on the Featured destinations cards, as well as adding an icon or a “Home” option in the navigation section.
      </p>
      <p class="goal-desc">Zeit Time Travel Tourism was a project that was both challenging and rewarding. With no direct conmpetitors, the research was tricky to begin with, but the similarities between the functionalities became clear as the research
        methods were implemented. Zeit has a lot of functionality potential and is something I would like to revisit and develop in the future</p>
